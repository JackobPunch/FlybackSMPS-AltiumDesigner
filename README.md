# Flyback SMPS – Altium Designer Project

## 📘 Project Description

This project presents a flyback switching mode power supply (SMPS) designed using **Altium Designer** as part of university coursework. The main purpose of the assignment was to become familiar with the PCB design workflow in Altium — including schematic capture, footprint assignment, and layout design.
